# playspot
Playground for spotify stuff.

Don't expect a real app even if this is a SailfishOS one. I just try to see how things can be done using qml + cpp + javascript. 

Right now for authentication is done using https://github.com/pipacs/o2
and for the API code from https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js is used.

O2 and spotify-web-api-js have ther own license. For playspot it is MIT.
